/**
 * A runtime exception to indicate when the result of an arithmetic operation 
 * results in an algebraic integer of higher algebraic degree than the 
 * implementation of {@link AlgebraicInteger} was designed for.
 * <p>For example, the square root of 2 times the fifth root of 3 is an 
 * algebraic integer with minimal polynomial <i>x</i><sup>10</sup> &minus; 288. 
 * So an AlgebraicInteger implementation for quadratic integers would be 
 * ill-suited to hold the result of the operation, as would an implementation 
 * that can handle algebraic integers up to algebraic degree 5. In such a case, 
 * it is appropriate to throw this exception.</p>
 * <p>If the result of an arithmetic operation is an algebraic integer of the 
 * same degree as the implementation can handle but the implementation can't 
 * represent that result for some other reason, {@link 
 * UnsupportedNumberDomainException} should be used instead; for example, in a 
 * package that can handle imaginary quadratic integers but not real quadratic 
 * integers, such as &radic;(&minus;2) &times; &radic;(&minus;5) = &radic;(10) 
 * &mdash; these three numbers are all of algebraic degree 2 but the result is a 
 * real quadratic integer rather than an imaginary quadratic integer.</p>
 * <p>Note that this was originally a checked exception; later on I decided it 
 * made more sense as a runtime exception.</p>
