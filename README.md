# Algebraic Integer Calculator

WORK IN PROGRESS: This grew out of the visualization of imaginary quadratic 
integer rings project.

When I started this project, I didn't really under Git or GitHub, so I was 
operating under various misconceptions. It wasn't until August 24, 2023 that I 
started correcting the deficiencies caused by certain unnecessary idiosyncracies 
that hopefully now only appear in the commits prior to that date.

This is a Java project. At one point it had a couple of Scala classes, but this 
was really quite unnecessary, as it is quite easy to use the project's compiled 
files in a local Scala REPL, making the REPL very vaguely similar to a Wolfram 
Mathematica notebook.

This project started out in Java 8 with JUnit 4. I have since upgraded to Java 
21, but because I'm using NetBeans rather than IntelliJ or Eclipse, I can't 
upgrade JUnit to JUnit 5.

Regardless, I'm in no rush to use Java 9 or later features.
