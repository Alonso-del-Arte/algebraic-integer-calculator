# Algebraic Integer Calculator

WORK IN PROGRESS: This grew out of the visualization of imaginary quadratic 
integer rings project.

When I started this project, I didn't really under Git or GitHub, so I was 
operating under various misconceptions. It wasn't until August 24, 2023 that I 
started correcting the deficiencies caused by certain unnecessary idiosyncracies 
that hopefully now only appear in the commits prior to that date.
